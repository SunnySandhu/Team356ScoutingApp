# Team356ScoutingApp
Author: Satvir Sandhu
The purpose of this application is to simplify the scouting process for Team 356 (VEX Robotics Team)

This application is designed to gather valuable scouting data from VEXDB, and to place it in a spreadsheeet, so that the team can manipulate the data to their liking.

Possible applications include: match predictions, alliance selection, and comparing teams performance (offensively, and defensively)

This application is designed to only be used with Python 3 on a Windows system, and it is strongly suggested that the user use the included spreadsheet for the program.
